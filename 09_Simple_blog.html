            <h3>1. DESIGN FOR MANKIND :</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>What It Is:</h4> A lifestyle blog by Erin Loechner, filled with beautifully-written essays on everything from design to parenting, marriage, work, travel and more.
                
                <h4>Why I Love It:</h4> I've never met Erin before in person, but she feels like such a kindred spirit. I have enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose. Her posts on navigating motherhood and marriage have always been some of my favorites. But I have always especially connected with her posts on slowing down, creativity, and self-care, probably because they're always words I need to take to heart myself. I really admire how open she has been to letting her career evolve and pivot in some big ways over the past decade, and I can't wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead</p>

            <h3>2. The ultimate summer guide to Rome</h3>
            <p>
                <h4> - Make the most of the mornings…</h4>
                June and September in Rome are hot, but the city can easily reach scorching daytime temperatures during July and August. Don’t let that stop you from exploring this beautiful place, though, just make sure to plan your activities for the beginning of the day. Get up early and be the first to see the sights; you’ll enjoy cooler morning temperatures, spend less time waiting in queues, and there’ll be fewer tourists in your photographs. Remember to bring a water bottle with you; there are small public drinking water fountains, known as ‘nasoni’, all over the city to help you keep hydrated!
                
                <h4> - …and the evenings!</h4>
                Apply the same rule to the evenings; things start to cool down around 4pm, and the locals won’t even think about having dinner until after 8 pm. If you’ve spent the hot afternoon relaxing in the shade or indoors (where there might even be air-conditioning), exploring the city can restart in the evening. At night, many of the piazzas, monuments and historic buildings are lit up. Head to the Trevi Fountain, or the spectacular Piazza Navona which often buzzes with artists and buskers after dark. Plus, lots of Rome’s big attractions, like the Vatican City and the Colosseum, offer night tours.</p>

            <h3>3. Living the game: Your guide to European football culture</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>1. France</h4>
                <h5>Football culture</h5> 

                Football fan culture in France is renowned for its vibrancy and passion. As the supporters of "Les Bleus" in bars or cafes around the country, they create a lively atmosphere that reflects their national identity.

                <h5>Songs & chants</h5>

                The national anthem, "La Marseillaise," holds significant historical and emotional significance for the French. Players and fans sing the anthem with gusto pre-match, creating a powerful sense of unity and pride. The lyrics call for resistance and bravery, resonating with the French spirit.

                <h5>Celebrations</h5>

                Celebrations in France, such as the Euros and World Cup victories, are amazing (and frequent). The streets come alive with parades, singing, and gatherings. Getting involved in French football fan culture is not necessarily about watching a game; it's about immersing yourself in a national identity and experiencing a communal celebration.

                <h4>2. Germany</h4>
                <h5>Football culture</h5> 

                The German national team, also known as Die Mannschaft, has achieved great success, fostering a strong sense of pride and unity among its supporters. As a result, bars and streets are filled with enthusiastic fans enjoying pints and pretzels.

                <h5>Songs & chants</h5>

                German football fans are known for creating electrifying atmospheres. They transform stadiums into cauldrons of noise, chanting "Super Deutschland" with coordinated pyrotechnical shows, including flags, flares, and banners.

                <h5>Celebrations</h5>

                Matchdays often extend beyond the confines of the stadium, with fans gathering in local squares and bars to watch games together, particularly during international football tournaments. There, the celebrations continue beyond the game, as fans enjoy a traditional post-match beer together.
